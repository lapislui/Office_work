1.) Describe the difference between mutable and immutable types in Python. Provide examples. 

Understanding Mutable :
mutable data types are which value can be changed after creation

List ,dictionaries and sets are mutable data types in Python

Eg code:
# List (mutable)
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print("Original List:", my_list)  # [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  
print("Modified List:", my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]


Immutable Types :
in which data types modification cannot be done are caled immutable datatypes

tuples are immutable

Eg code:

# Tuple (immutable)
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print("Original Tuple:", my_tuple)  # (1, 2, 3)

# Trying to modify a tuple directly
try:
    my_tuple[0] = 10  # Attempt to change the first element
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error:", e)  # Will raise a TypeError
